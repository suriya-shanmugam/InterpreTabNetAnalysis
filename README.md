# InterpreTabNet: Enhancing Interpretability of Tabular Data

## Overview
InterpreTabNet is an innovative machine learning model designed to improve the interpretability of predictions made on tabular data. It builds upon the TabNet architecture by introducing sparse attention masks, which allow for clearer feature selection and enhanced interpretability without compromising accuracy.

## Key Features
- **Sparse Attention Masks**: Utilizes the Gumbel-Softmax distribution to create distinct, non-overlapping feature masks.
- **Improved Interpretability**: Provides better insights into which features are most important for predictions.
- **Competitive Accuracy**: Maintains high accuracy across various datasets while enhancing interpretability.
- **Post-Hoc Textual Explanations**: Employs large language models to generate natural language descriptions of feature importance.
